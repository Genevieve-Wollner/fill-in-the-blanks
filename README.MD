# Fill in the Blanks!

A fun little game where you fill in the missing lyrics to some songs. Each difficulty has 3 different randomly selected songs!

- You will need to make sure Python is installed on your computer. You can follow the instructions [here](https://www.howtogeek.com/197947/how-to-install-python-on-windows/) to install Python on a Windows machine. Python is already installed on Macs.
- Download the fill_in_the_blanks_game folder (Which you must have done to read this!)
